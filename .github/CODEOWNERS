# CODEOWNERS: https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/
# This file marks who is the "owner" of several files and directory on this GitHub
# repository. This is mostly used to assign reviews on new PRs.
#
# - Directories and files which are assigned to a team should be interepreted as
#   "collectively owned". GitHub will automatically assign members of the team
#   to review the PR, in a round-robin fashion.
# - Directories and files which are owned by one specific user X are to be
#   interpreted as "primarily maintained by X". Any significant changes to
#   that given code should be reviewed by X; as if it were another repository
#   where X is the primary developer. However, ownership here can be ignored if
#   it arises as a result of refactorings, or other very minor changes to that
#   specific code.
#   Directories and files owned by one specific user should be for components
#   that are somewhat decoupled from the rest of the codebase.
# - Directories and files which are owned by a team, and followed by a specific
#   user Y, are to be interpreted as collectively owned by the team, but where Y
#   is the main stakeholder in that directory, and should be involved for any
#   significant changes to ensure alignment with the original vision.
#
# The list and guidelines are non-definitive and in flux. Use your best judgement.

# Primary repo maintainers.
